        G'day ! (Claimed Australian slang)<br/>
        And Merry Christmas to you all. I hope you had a lovely one.

        My Christmas Eve was a bit uncanny this year, flying on Christmas Eve from Tasmania to Melbourne, and cooking kangaroo burgers at a public barbecue on the 25th while playing Frisbee under a 30Â° sunshine.

        It was a enriching trip though, socially and culturally speaking. It started with 9 days of volunteering for an huge and quite famous event in Victoria, the Great Victorian Bike Ride.

        Imagine you gathering some friends and having a small bike ride in the countryside. This was pretty much how this event felt like, albeit this one gathered 5200 riders and 400 volunteers, riding 500km over nine days and taking place in the iconic Great Ocean Road. A bit challenging but definitely not a race at all, this events aims at having some good and friendly time with people enjoying bicycles.

        Volunteers were split into 35 groups and most of them didn't have to ride, carried from campsite to campsite by several coaches. They provide much of the labour for the ride, which helps keep costs down and therefore lowers entry fees for riders. They are in charge with pitching tents, serving meals, medical service, handling luggage, entertaining and so on.

        I found my way in the Media team, in charge of writing articles for the daily specialized newspapers of the event, namely the 'Good Oil'. Along with my three colleagues, our jobs consisted in interviewing participants and writing stories. Auxiliary, we were also taking care of carrying a portable toilet around, which granted us the right to have our own car - a pearl when it comes to do a bit of sightseeing in the empty Victorian's bush.

        And empty it was. To give you an idea, anytime our small community was setting up a campsite somewhere, we were instantaneously becoming the biggest and most populated town of the area. All the villages we were passing by had from 10 to 2000 souls, and usually one or two pubs were the only business. To them, the bike ride was quite a special event, making more sales than on New Years Eve.

        Although pretty basic comfort conditions, this volunteering was a lot of fun: You meet a bunch of nice people, all of them being there for having a good time. Also, you live at no expenses and you are given some free stuff away, such as shirts and hats. Moreover it was an amazing opportunity to meet local Australians, as most of the participants were from Victoria despite the huge amount of backpackers in Melbourne.

        I left to Tasmania almost as soon as I came back from the bike ride in order to experience another amazing way to meet locals and live at no expenses while traveling, namely Woofing. The concept is quite simple: you work for someone in exchange of a bed and food. Most of the time, you will be hosted by folks living in an environmentally friendly house remotely from any town in the surrounding, owning a descent piece of land. The odd jobs you are given often relate with entertaining this big piece of land, such as gardening, or digging holes and pouring concrete in order to build an extension to their beloved home.

        Even though I consider myself as a city-person, I must say it feels good to live in such a house. The more remote the house is, the more it tends to be self-sufficient. You collect eggs from your chickens, you fish your own seafood, you give your waste back to the chickens, you grow vegetables in your garden, you eat the chickens. This is what daily life looks like.

        Tasmanians' hosts even go further than that. Not even they grow their own food, they also collect rainwater into water-tank and drink it without any form of treatment. I was really surprised when I have learned that the water I had been drinking for weeks was directly coming from the rain, but this is actually perfectly fine in Tasmania. Indeed this is a specificity from Tasmania: don't try it at home. The island is so untouched and covered with forests, it has the purest air of the whole world.

        Woofing is a very special way to be accommodated. The first host family was holding a guest house, from 120$ a night and obviously free for us as woofers. Well, we were not hosted as if we were guests, as our room was in a separate spider-infested building, but we were still sharing the fantastic breakfast. However, as a Woofer, you belong to the hosts' side rather than the guests' side of the business. Indeed, you have to keep in mind that you actually live within the family instead of being a simple customer, and this makes the whole difference. You share the table during dinner, take afternoon tea with them, share their laughs and their issues. During our two weeks stay at this family, our host's father had a stroke and she had to fly back to Perth to see him. We were in the middle of this, whereas we didn't know these people a week before, and were now given a full description of her family. While woofing you actually become close to your hosts.

        However, staying the whole time with them might not bring you to see most of the landscapes the country has to offer. This is why we took few days off and rented a car in the sake of visiting some of the many Tasmania's National Parks. Driving 700km and walking for around 14h total within three days, we tried to cover the East Coast. We went to the renowned Freycinet and its iconic white-sand Wineglass beach, Douglas-Apsley with its long and unsigned track down the river, Tasman and its superb coastal scenery and Mt Field with its magnificent Russell falls.

        I did many hikes in my life, mostly in France, England and Germany, but nothing half as impressive as the tracks in Tasmania. The wildlife is stunning. The forest is dense, tall and have an eucalyptus flavor. It is not unusual to cross wallabies, though Tasmanian devil is quite rare and endangered due to a disease killing most of them.

        Before I came to Tasmania, I thought hiking there was reserved to an elite of bush walkers like Bear Grylls, only them being able to find their way in the bush and fighting deadly snakes and spiders. Well, I was wrong. Walking in the bush out of the track can be quite dangerous as it is easy to get lost, but it is perfectly safe if you follow the track. There are indeed some spiders and snakes, although they are very shy and will runaway from you rather than jump on your face. When you come down to Australia, you should not be afraid of what can kill you, otherwise you would not go very far out. What you should rather consider is what actually go for you. It turns out that Tasmanian's snakes and spiders are pretty much pacific, most of the nasty things live in Northern Australia, Queensland. Some snakes are aggressive, crocodiles are a real concern and sharks too, along with jellyfishes. But again, except from sharks that strikes randomly (and even then, statistically they strike rarely) you won't have any problem if you listen to your common sense. Crocodiles and jellyfishes are tracked, most of the deadly attack involve too curious tourists.

        What you should be afraid of though is the sunshine, really strong in Australia due to the hole in the ozone layer. It is the country with the most skin cancer per inhabitants, it is therefore witted to always carry some sunscreen and a hat when you go hiking.

        These holidays were really nice, but discussing with locals and sightseeing Tasmania I realized that a car is actually necessary to discover Australia in its all beauty. Even Tasmania is seven times bigger than Corsica.

        Within the next days, I will stay around Melbourne and do some more woofing close to the city. I will give another shot at finding a job on the beginning of January. Also, if I have enough spare time for that, I will upload these letters on my website decorated with some pictures and my one second video project.

        See you soon !<br/>
        Jacques
