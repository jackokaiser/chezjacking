          This is an AirBnB clone, where users can rent their cars to other users.

          It is a client side wep application, that I coded upon a MEAN stack.
          The features so far include:

          *   Authentication
            *   Sign up
            *   Login with Facebook/Google
          *   Create car with availabilities, location and price (only if logged in)
          *   Search for cars (location and dates)

          Feel free to [try it live](http://air-car-and-car.tk "air-car-and-car"),
          or alternativly browse the sources on [github](https://github.com/jackokaiser/air-car-and-car "air-car-and-car").

          There, I coded a small raymarcher that emulates lava lamp behaviour.
          The point was to highlight the differences between
          a *Raytracer* and a *Raymarcher*.
          When the first solves equations in order to find an intersection
          with the surface,
          the second evaluates potential of objects in space
          and determines whether it has crossed the surface or not.

          Note that we can achieve smoother results with the marching technique.

           Here is the small raytracer.
           It is a standalone that I coded from scratch,
           I haven't put quite as much work as I did for the one I've
           coded for [Skimlab](http://skimlab.com "Skimlab"), but still.

           This one involves shadows, one level reflection,
           and perlin noise to compute spheres' color.
           It is running in real-time on my laptop, though the long shaders
           can take few seconds to compile.

           I took the Startup engineering class on Coursera.
           The final projects was a bitcoin based crowdfounding website,
           in order to found our own apps.

           This class got me interested into startup and web technologies,
           a field in which I was a complete neophyte.
           Fortunately, as I was doing my internship at
           [Skimlab](http://skimlab.com "Skimlab") in the meantime,
           I had perfect insights on what I was being taught.
