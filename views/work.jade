            This internship is in the framwork of my second year of Master of Science in Informatics at Grenoble (MoSIG).
            It is a renown, international research master specialized in Graphics, Vision and Robotics.

            During this intern I was a member of the team [CHROMA](http://www.inria.fr/en/teams/chroma "Chroma")
            (previously known as [e-Motion](https://team.inria.fr/e-motion/en/ "e-motion")) specialized in autonomous robots.
            Under the supervisation of Agostino Martinelli, I have been investigating a novel Closed-Form method
            to fuse intertial and visual information.

            We see this method being particularly suited to drones since a popular choice of on board sensors are a camera along with
            an inertial measurement unit (IMU). It can be used as an initialization to more popular filter-based algorithms, such as
            the Extended Kalman Filter (EKF), which are able to perform long-term fusion.

            I implemented the closed form in [ethzasl_ptam](https://github.com/jackokaiser/ethzasl_ptam/tree/CF-init "ptam"),
            a ROS package that deals with pose estimation using visual information.
            Before, the initialization of PTAM was done through 8-point algorithm over a pair of stereo images,
            but it could only determine the distance to the features up to a global scale.
            Now, if we're fed with inertial data, the initialization can be done by the closed form and has the advantage to provide
            distance to features at the right scale.

            [Shwish](https://shwish.com/ "Shwish")
            is an early stage Australian startup developing an online collaborative gifting platform,
            that is like Kickstarter for your friends' wishes and projects.

            Being a small team, I had the chance to work on every side of the project: design implementation, front-end, back-end,
            database and devOps. The application being client side, built on a MEAN stack, the largest task was to implement
            the front-end with Angularjs.

            [Skimlab](http://www.skimlab.com/ "Skimlab")
            is another early stage startup. The business model is to provide an easy online tool for modeling 3D objects
            which relies on implicit surface.
            It is possible to purchase such designed objects, a 3D printed instance will be shipped.

            More recently, they released their new product [Jweel](https://www.jweel.com/en/ "Jweel") that provides specific features
            for designing and printing jewellery.

            I worked on WebGL shader development to enhance and speed up rendering.
            It involved good knowledge of JavaScript, Three.js, glsl and WebGL.

           Development of an application for mesh deformation
           on a virtual reality platform. In order
           to be realtime, it has been built upon
           [CGoGN](http://cgogn.unistra.fr/ "CGoGN"),
           a powerful library that provides an efficient
           implementation of combinatorial maps,
           maintained by the iCube laboratory. The application
           worked through a 3D cursor,
           the avatar of the user.

           The positioning issue refers to the fact
           that, desptite the improvments of 3D technologies,
           it remains hard to guess relative depth
           of objects in space. I implemented solutions
           where the cursor gives hints on its position by
           scaling and orienting itself toward the closest
           object in space. We tryed out many different
           shapes and updating methods.
           The final version of the cursor has been used
           for the mesh deformation app.
