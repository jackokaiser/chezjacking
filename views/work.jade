            [Shwish](https://shwish.com/ "Shwish")
            is an early stage Australian startup developing an online collaborative gifting platform,
            that is like Kickstarter for your friends' wishes and projects.

            Being a small team, I had the chance to work on every side of the project: design implementation, front-end, back-end,
            database and devOps. The application being client side, built on a MEAN stack, the largest task was to implement
            the front-end with Angularjs.

            is another early stage startup. The business model is to provide an easy online tool for modeling 3D objects
            which relies on implicit surface.
            It is possible to purchase such designed objects, a 3D printed instance will be shipped.

            More recently, they released their new product [Jweel](https://www.jweel.com/en/ "Jweel") that provides specific features
            for designing and printing jewellery.

            I worked on WebGL shader development to enhance and speed up rendering.
            It involved good knowledge of JavaScript, Three.js, glsl and WebGL.

           Development of an application for mesh deformation
           on a virtual reality platform. In order
           to be realtime, it has been built upon
           [CGoGN](http://cgogn.unistra.fr/ "CGoGN"),
           a powerful library that provides an efficient
           implementation of combinatorial maps,
           maintained by the iCube laboratory. The application
           worked through a 3D cursor,
           the avatar of the user.

           The positioning issue refers to the fact
           that, desptite the improvments of 3D technologies,
           it remains hard to guess relative depth
           of objects in space. I implemented solutions
           where the cursor gives hints on its position by
           scaling and orienting itself toward the closest
           object in space. We tryed out many different
           shapes and updating methods.
           The final version of the cursor has been used
           for the mesh deformation app.
